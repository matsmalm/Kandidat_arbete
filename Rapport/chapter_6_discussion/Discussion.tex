\chapter{Discusion}
This chapter contains analysis of each algorithm, why it did or did
not work, how it compares to the other algorithms and a
conclusion. The main purpose is to present conclusions from the data presented
in the previous chapter. 
\section{Analysis}
An analysis of each algorithm,  evaluation of why it did or did not work. \par

\section{Comparsion and statistics}
A comparsion between the algorithms, and perhaps also with MILP. \par
