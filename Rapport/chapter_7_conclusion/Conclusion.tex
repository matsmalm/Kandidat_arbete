\chapter{Conclusion}
In this paper heuristic algorithms were developed for the pursuit and evasion problem. Three fundamentally different heuristic methods were considered: tabu search, genetic algorithms and greedy methods. The result was three algorithms. Two algorithms and a simulation environment was implemented in ANSI C. The implementation of the simulation environment discretized the considered environment into a number of quadratic \emph{tiles}. The algorithms were run on a vast amount of randomly generated environments. Data on the results of the executions was attained and evaluated. The data implied that the implemented algorithms performed well on small environments considering both the \emph{quality} of the solution \emph{path} and the computational \emph{efficiency} compared to related work. For bigger environments the implemented algorithms are insufficient and an enhancement is needed in order to attain satisfying results.
