\chapter{Conclusion}
In this paper heuristic algorithms were developed for the pursuit and evasion problem. Three fundamentaly different heuristic methods were considered: tabu search, genetic algorithms and greedy methods. The result was three algorithms. Two algorithms and a simulation enviroment was implemented in ANSI C. The implementation of the simulation enviroment discretizes the considered enviroment into a number of quadratic tiles. The algorithms were run on a vast amount of randomly generated enviroments. Data on the results of the executions was attained and evaluated. The data implied that the implemented algorithms performed well on small enviroments considering both the quality of the solution path and the computational efficency compared to related work. For bigger enviroments the implemented algorithms are insufficient and an enhancement is needed in order to attain satisfying results.
