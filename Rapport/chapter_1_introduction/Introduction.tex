\chapter{Introduction}

\section{Objektiv}
The goal of this research is to solve a pursuit evasion problems in a two dimensional environment, with the help of heuristic problem solving methods.
In short, the problem is: given a surface with static obstacles and a number of pursuers ensure that an evader cannot exist within the area. A complete formulation of the problem can be seen in Chapter 2

The problem itself is solved. An algorithm providing an optimal solution already exists.
The problem yet to be solved, is the problem of finding a solution within a reasonable computational time, it is here where heuristic methods comes in to play

With great risk for loss of optimality, our goal is to use heuristic methods to find a solution with a reasonable computational time
 
This report is therefore a study of the balance between a reasonable computational time and the loss of optimality.

\section{Background}

\subsection{What is optimization}

Optimization is a mathematical discipline, for solving various types of problems. With the aim of finding the best, available, values of some objective function given a defined domain. If one wants to know more advise NAME ON LITETUR\\

Optimization Theory offers a variety of solution method to a wide range of problems. For the solution process of these problems, it is important to identify what kind of problems one deals with.
Relevant distinction can be done by studying the problem complexity.

Complexity is more or less computational time. There are many different complexity classes of problems, but two of the most fundamental is/are the P and NP

\subsection{P \& NP problems}

The distinction between these two reviles the difficulty of ore problem. I won't go in to specific detail, concerning sub classes etc, only a brief intuitive description.
For a more detailed and interesting reed advise[sisst referens 4]

P is the set of problems which can be solved by a deterministic Turing machine using a polynomial amount of computation time.
Cobham Edmonds thesis holds that P is the class of computational problems which are "efficiently solvable" or "tractable". In practice, some problems not known to be in P have practical solutions, and some that are in P do not, but this is a useful rule of thumb.

NP refere to Nondeterministic Polynomial time. and can be intuitively described as the set of problems for which, a found solution can be verified to actually be the correct solution, using a deterministic Turing machine using a polynomial amount of computation time.

A set of descriptions that leads one to wonder whether
P = NP
In what the essence is:
Suppose that solutions to a problem can be verified quickly. Then, can the solutions themselves also be computed quickly?
Or stated differently, douse it exists such an algorithm that can calculate such a solution quickly?
A unsolved question considered by many to be the most important problem in the feeld in computer science. 

Within the class NP there are a few subclasses where, intuitively, the hardest problems among the subclasses are called NP-hard.

With by dffinitun are problems of the type for which no polynomial-time algorithms are known. 

As stated above there is still an open question whether such algorithms actually exist for NP problems, and by corollary, all NP problems [referens 1]. It is widely believed that this is not the case 

This is very relevant to our problem, related work has shown that the problem in question is at least NP-hard [reference 2] wich is a set of problems said to be a class of problems That, informally are, at least as hard as the hardest Problems in NP.

\subsection{(the need for) a near optimal solution}

Due to the fact that the problem in question is NP-hard and thus the possibilities of finding an optimal solution within reasonable computing time are/is seen to be very low. Does the logical thread has brought us to be prepared to sacrifice optimality
This sacrifice leads us to a larger spectrum of possible approaches to the problem.

 \subsection {Pursuit and evasion problem with multiple pursuers.}
The pursuit evasion problem, also known as "Lion and man" \cite{Dumitrescu08}, is a problem where an pursuer is to find an evader in an environment. An extension to this is the multi pursuer version, which is used in \cite{paper1},\cite{paper2} and \cite{paper3}.\\
\\
The Pursuit Evasion problem. \emph{Given an evader, a set of N pursuers and a polygonal free space F, find a solution strategy P such that for every continuous function e : }[0, $\infty$) $\rightarrow$ F \emph{there exists a time $\tau$ and an i such that e($\tau$) $\in$ V($p_i$($\tau$)), i.e., the pursuer will always be seen by some evader, regardless of its path.}\cite{paper1}

\subsection{Heuristic methods}

Heuristic methods are a bransch of methods used in computer science and mathematics to make educated guesses to help find solutions to a problem. Generally heuristic methods douse not provide correct / optimal solutions but it offers a reasonably fast computed solution. Heuristic methods are therefore often used, very powerful, in combination with deterministic methods, to speed up the process.

The characteristics of a heuristic is partly that there is no evidence of that it works, or else it would be a deterministic method. The idea of heuristic methods is thus to improve the chances of finding the desired solution. Pure random guesses forms no heuristic method.

There are several occasions where a heuristic method is preferable to a deterministic method.
Here are a few:

\begin{itemize}
\item There is no known algorithm for solving a specific problem, a heuristic is the only way to approach a solution
\item A good algorithm can be difficult to implement and heuristics can sometimes be accepted because it is easy to describe in a programming language and that heuristic methods are known to produce good results.
\item The problem is too difficult to solve efficiently and quickly with deterministic methods. A heuristic method could overcome that and give an acceptable but probably not an optimal solution
\end{itemize}

Where the last point corresponds to the problem we are dealing with.
