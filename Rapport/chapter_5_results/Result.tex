\chapter{Results}
The algorithms were run on iMac's with 2.66GHz Intel Core2Duo and 4GB of RAM. Each machine was given an environment of a specified size.\footnote{Environments of size 5x5, 10x10, 15x15 and 20x20 were used}. The data acquired is summarized in table \ref{SimData}.
%% Tables with data
\begin{table}[t!hb]
\begin{tabular}{| c | r | r | r | r | r | r | r | r | }

%% End of tables
\\ From the simulations the following observations were made:
\begin{itemize}
\item{The results were dependent on parameter values.}
\item{For environments of size 5x5 were solved with good quality for both the tabu search and the genetic algorithm, however tabu search were faster in finding a solution.}
\item{Environments of size 10x10 and larger were not always solved with less than 4 pursuers.}
\item{When tabu search found a solution, it was often of better quality than the genetic algorithm.}
\item{For environments of size 10x10 and larger, the genetic algorithm found a solution more often than tabu search.}
\item{For environments of size 10x10 and larger, the quality of the solution, if found, varied in steps and computation time.}
\end{itemize}

%%Statistics, tables and a description of the tables. Also motivation to why we have chosen these tables etc.\\\\ %%Results for MILP\footnote{Mixed Integer Linear Programming, see \cite{paper3}} evaluation could also be added here.\\\\
