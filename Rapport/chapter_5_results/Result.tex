\chapter{Results}
The algorithms were run on iMac's with 2.66GHz Intel Core2Duo and 4GB of RAM. Each machine was given environments of a specified size\footnote{Environments of size 5x5, 9x9, 10x10, 15x15 and 20x20 were used}, where the density of obstacles was either 25\% or 40\%. Figure \ref{Envs} shows examples of environments of size 10x10 with (a) 25\% obstacle density and (b) 40\% density that were used.\\*
Except from the Manhattan\footnote{A special symmetric environment, see \cite{paper1}} grid each machine was given 10 random generated environments of equal size and two different random starting positions for each environment. Each algorithm was given a set of parameters that were tuned in order to find a solution with two pursuers, however each environment was run for 5-2 pursuers. The algorithms were also given a maximum number of steps for each pursuer to take, long enough to find a solution.\\
The algorithms were then to find a solution of as few steps as possible for a given number of pursuers. If neither of the algorithms were able to find a solution within the given maximum steps no further attempts of finding a solution with the same or fewer pursuers and the same starting positions were made for either of the algorithms.\\
In table \ref{SimData} the data acquired is summarized.\\*
The "Average step difference" is given by the difference in steps used for the genetic algorithm and tabu search algorithm in successful cases, divided by the number of successful runs for the given environment and number of pursuers.\\*
The "Average time" is the time for each run divided by the number of runs, where both successful and unsuccessful runs were counted.

\newpage From the simulations the following observations were made:
\begin{itemize}
\item{The results were dependent on parameter values.}
\item{For environments of size 5x5 were solved with good quality for both the tabu search and the genetic algorithm, however tabu search were faster in finding a solution.}
\item{Environments of size 10x10 and larger were not always solved with less than 4 pursuers.}
\item{When tabu search found a solution, it was often of better quality than the genetic algorithm.}
\item{For environments of size 10x10 and larger, the genetic algorithm found a solution more often than tabu search.}
\item{For environments of size 10x10 and larger, the quality of the solution, if found, varied in steps and computation time.}
\end{itemize}
