In this paper heursitic algorithms are developed for the pursuit evasion problem in polygonal enviroments. The problem consists of constructing continous trajectories for a group of pursuers, searching for an evader, in such a way that the evader is guaranteed to be seen at some time during the search. Three fundamentaly different heuristic methods are considered, trying to create algorithms that can find a solution to the problem. The three heuristic methods considered are tabu search, a genetic algorithm and a greedy algorithm. The result is two readily implemented fast algorithms that yields solutions of high quality. The report attains and evaluates statistics on runtime, and the quality of the solution for a vast amount of randomly generated enviroments.\\
