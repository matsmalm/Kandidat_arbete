In this report we extend the former work of the article  ``A Boolean Control Network Approach to Pursuit 
Evasion Problems in Polygonial Environments'' \cite{paper1}. We try to implement three fundamentaly different heuristic methods to create algorithms that can find a solution to the same problem formulation as in \cite{paper1}. The three heuristic methods considered are tabu search, genetic algorithms and a greedy algorithm. The result is two readily implemented algorithms that yields a solution with a quality better than or equal to, and faster than, the former work. The report attains and evaluates statistics on runtime, number of pursuers and the quality of the solution for a number of randomly generated enviroments.\\
