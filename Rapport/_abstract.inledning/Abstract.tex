In this paper heursitic algorithms are developed for the pursuit evasion problem in polygonal enviroments. In this problem, continuous trajectories shall be constructed for a group of pursuers, searching for an evader, in such a way that the evader is guaranteed to be seen at some time during the search.
%The problem consists of constructing continous trajectories for a group of pursuers, searching for an evader, in such a way that the evader is guaranteed to be seen at some time during the search.
Three fundamentaly different heuristic methods are considered: tabu search, genetic algorithms and greedy methods. The result is three heuristic algorithms. Two algorithms are readily implemented and fast yielding solutions of high quality compared to previous work to the best of our knowledge. The report attains and evaluates statistics on runtime, and the quality of the solution for a vast amount of randomly generated enviroments.\\
