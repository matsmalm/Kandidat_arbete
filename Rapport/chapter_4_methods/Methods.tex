\chapter{Methods}
In this report it was decided to use the heuristic concepts from greedy methods, tabu search and genetic algorithms to construct the algorithms. These methods has been intentionally chosen so that each method strongly differs in its characteristics from the other two. Greedy methods are local and deterministic in their approach. Both tabu search and genetic algorithms are stochastic and global in their approach, but they differ significantly in how they examine and construct feasible solutions. The reason for this decision was to examine if some conclusion could be made about if any specific characteristics would be favourable for solving our problem.
