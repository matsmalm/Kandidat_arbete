\chapter{Environment}
A description of the simulation environment we have created, containing how we created it, why we needed to create it and motivation of the choices we made.\\
The environment is constructed so that it is possible to generate random environment as well as design environments by hand.
\section{Our simulation environment}
Our simulation environment consists of two parts, a generator of environment (see Appendix 1, EnvGen.c) and a node-network generator (appendix 1, NodeGen.c).\par
\subsection{Generator}
The environment generator has length, width and number of obstacles as input. Using that it creates environment that is guaranteed to be convex.\\\\
Every environment created can be considered to be built of squares. This results in that diagonal edges will not be created, but since a diagonal can be created by a line of obstacles if the resolution is high enough, that should not be a problem.\\\\
If the environment is guaranteed convex it is added to a output file as a array.

\subsection{Node network}
Our node-network generator takes a matrix as input and generates a graph network, which is to be used by our algorithms.\\
The array can either be generated, se previous subsection, or hand-made.\\
