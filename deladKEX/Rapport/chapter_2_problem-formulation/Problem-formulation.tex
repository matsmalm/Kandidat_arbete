\chapter{Problem formulation}
%The essentials of our problem formulation today is "To test
%implementation of greedy approach, tabu search and genetic programming
%and evaluation." The exact formulation is in progress...
original problem is the multipursuer version of the pursuit evasion problem.
we base our work on paper 1 "boolean control" to see if we can develop the idea of a discretation of the enviroment further and use heuristics to find a good solutions in a short time.
our main purpose: test three heuristic algorithms with different conceptual basis and collect data to compare under what kind of conditions each method excels or fails.


\section{Problem with the problem}
the original problem, given by guidas et tal [referens!!] is known to be NP-hard. Here we have relaxed version of the problem.

the headline is self explanatory, the ide her is to discuss the P vs NP aspekt.
maybe this will be incorporated with another part of the introduction


\section{Approach}
A description of our approach to the problem. Describing the overview
of our approach. Mentioning the creation of an testing enviroment,
choice and application of heuristics and target data to evaluate the effectiveness.
