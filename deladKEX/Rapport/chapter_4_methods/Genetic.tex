\section{Genetic}
\subsection{Description}
Genetic algorithms is based on the idea of evolution. Using a combination of reproduction, mutation and survival of the fittest a solution is generated. %%Genetic algorithms does not guarantee an optimal solution, however 
\subsection{Algorithm}
A description of the algorithm\\
%%Selection: A combination of elitism and random selection was used. Elitism to make sure good solutions was not lost, by always keeping all feasible solutions that solved the pursuit-evasion problem, and random selection to maintain a diversity.\\
%%Crossover: \\
%%Mutation: To make sure that all solutions can be obtained, mutations is used. However, to make sure that it will not only be a random search, the chance of mutation was 1% at crossover and 0% in all other cases.\\

\subsection{Implementation}
A description of how the algorithm is implemented
\subsection{ Development process}
How the development of the algorithm have proceeded.\\
%%\\
%%Parameters was set according to:\\
%%Cromosome length was set to \begin{math}n^2\end{math}, to be able to cover the entire environment.\\
%%Population size was set to ..., using 10.1.1.105.2431 "Optimal Population Size and the Genetic Algorithm".\\
%%Instance size was set to ...\\
%%Number of generations was set to ...\\
